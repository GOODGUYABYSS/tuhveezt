# IDAssignment3 Integrated Project
Project Name: Tuhveezt

Beak Wei Xiang did not appear to push because we were sharing coding environments using liveshare on VSCode. Thus, we only needed one person to push both of our works. 

This is our to-do list app prototype with a built-in time tracker and leveling system. It is designed to combine 3 important features of productivity apps. Time tracking, task tracking, and motivation. 

This application solves a personal problem of mine and a lot of people in terms of productivity tools because of this combination. Previously, 3 apps were needed to implement all of this. Those apps are Todoist (task tracking), Toggl (Time Tracking), and Habitica (Task Gamification). This application attempts to combine all of those ideas elegantly into one tool that is effective for most users' requirements.

In this prototype, we have created the most we can with the time given. So far, we created the fundamental aspects of the application, which are time-tracking, task creation, deletion and modification, leveling and reward system (using our 3D models as the rewards for the user), and saving all these items in a database to be used later when the user goes back to the website. 

## Design Process
We decided to go for a sci-fi theme website as it looks cool. and blah blah

This website is for people who wishes to improve their productivity by tracking what are the tasks that they have to do and at the same time, keep track of how much time they have spent on each task.

As a to-do list user, I always feel the need to know how much time I have spent on each task, so that I can improve productivity and ensure that I am not spending too much time one task, leaving other tasks with little to no time. 

As a time-tracking app user, I feel that there is a need to keep track of my remaining tasks to do, so that I will not only be able to just track how much time I spend on a task, but also be able to see what other tasks I have to.

## Technologies Used
Bootstrap
RestDB
Jquery
fontawesome(icons for socials)

## Testing
This website is only built for desktop website browsers.

When bridging the website to the RestDB database, I had to think of what types of data I would need. For example, for our gamification idea of the website, we knew that we needed xp and levels, but did not know how we are going to display it and also how we are going to post the data to the database. Hence, when we were doing the gamifcation part, we had to really think through each step from knowing what types of data we need, creating the data and to displaying the results to our website.
